        "A. Alzheimer's Disease often does not show noticeable clinical symptoms until there is already somewhat advanced molecular pathology. This means that early detection of AD is necessary if we hope to prevent brain damage and cognitive decline. Early detection of AD is difficult because the symptoms are not yet measurable.\n",
        "Q. How widespread is the issue that you are researching? How many people are affected by it? How much money is wasted dealing with this issue each year?\n",
        "A. More than 6 million Americans have AD and AD is expected to cost the US $345 billion in 2023 and that number is expected to grow to over $1 trillion by 20250.\n",
        "Q. What approach has prior research taken to address this issue? What methods or perspectives have been used to try and solve this problem?\n",
        "A. Broadly, prior research has used a number of different input variables to predict AD development. These include features extracted from imaging and signal data, genetic data, and neuropsychological data. Prediction algorithms range from heavily parameterized and biologically motivated models to data-driven machine learning models. Relevant to my project, people have used hemodynamic measures in the past such as CBF and ATT as input variables to neural networks to predict AD development. \n",
        "Q. How did the outcomes of prior research contribute to an understand of or solution to this issue?\n",
        "A. Prior research has established that CBF and ATT are related to symptoms of AD, such as hippocmapal volume, white matter signal abnormality volume, and scores on neuropsychological examinations such as NIH toolbox. There is a lot of evidence that correlations between hemodynamic measures and AD symptoms exist.\n",
        "Q. Where do the outcomes of prior research fall short? What need still exists that has not been satisfied by prior research?\n",
        "A. While strong correlations between hemodynamic measures and AD symptoms ahve been found, prior research has not successfully found a robust method for predicting AD development longitudinally, before clinical symptoms present. This is problematic because it means that we cannot detect AD early enough to prevent brain damage and cognitive decline.\n",
        "Q. Give a short summary of your proposed project. What approach will you use that has not been used before, and why will this approach enable you to satisfy the unmet need when prior research couldn't?\n",
        "A. I will use convolutional neural networks to detect late-onset Alzheimer's disease before cognitive symptoms become measureable. The input to the network will be cortical surface maps of cerebral blood flow and arterial transit time, calculated from arterial spin labeling MRI scans and FreeSurfer's cortical surface reconstruction. This research is the first to use vertex-wise hemodynamic data directly as input to a CNN rather than using summary measures as inputs to a more traditional neural network structure. This may be more effective at early diagnosis than existing methods because vertex-wise data is incredibly high-dimensional and difficult for humans to interpret. However, this complexity may be exactly what is needed to predict symptomatic decline. \n",
        "Q. When you fill these holes in prior research, why will that be useful? How will it benefit the people suffering from the core issue?\n",
        "A. Earlier diagnosis means better treatment which means better patient outcomes. This will greatly reduce financial and emotional burden on both patients and caregivers everywhere, as well as save the U.S. healthcare system billions of dollars.\n",
        "Q. When you fill these holes in prior research, how will it move your field forward? How the concepts, methods, technologies, treatments, services, or preventative interventions that drive this field will be changed if the proposed aims are achieved?\n",
        "A. This will be groundbreaking work on a new research strategy of using hemodynamic cortical surface maps as direct inputs to CNNs for prediction of clinical variables. If achievable, this will not only focus the field on a promising new research avenue, but also provide a framework for using this new methodology to study other pathologies.\n",
        "Q. Why is NOW an opportune time for this research to be conducted? What new technological or conceptual advance has enabled this research such that it could not have been done in the past? Why is it pressing enough that it cannot wait until the future?\n",
        "A. Recent advances in the field of data science such as intuitive deep learning software packages, cloud computing services, and conceptual work on neural network structure has democratized what used to be considered advanced techniques. As recently as 10 years ago, very few labs would have had the compute power or computer science knowledge to conduct research with advanced CNN techniques. In addition, ASL MRI is a relatively new technique. multi-delay ASL allowing for the computation of ATT is even newer and still not widely available. There has never been a better tiem to perform this style of research.'''\n",

Give a short summary of the issue that your research is hoping to address.\n",
              "A. Alzheimer&#x27;s Disease often does not show noticeable clinical symptoms until there is already somewhat advanced molecular pathology. This means that early detection of AD is necessary if we hope to prevent brain damage and cognitive decline. Early detection of AD is difficult because the symptoms are not yet measurable.\n",
              "Q. How widespread is the issue that you are researching? How many people are affected by it? How much money is wasted dealing with this issue each year?\n",
              "A. More than 6 million Americans have AD and AD is expected to cost the US $345 billion in 2023 and that number is expected to grow to over $1 trillion by 20250.\n",
              "Q. What approach has prior research taken to address this issue? What methods or perspectives have been used to try and solve this problem?\n",
              "A. Broadly, prior research has used a number of different input variables to predict AD development. These include features extracted from imaging and signal data, genetic data, and neuropsychological data. Prediction algorithms range from heavily parameterized and biologically motivated models to data-driven machine learning models. Relevant to my project, people have used hemodynamic measures in the past such as CBF and ATT as input variables to neural networks to predict AD development. \n",
              "Q. How did the outcomes of prior research contribute to an understand of or solution to this issue?\n",
              "A. Prior research has established that CBF and ATT are related to symptoms of AD, such as hippocmapal volume, white matter signal abnormality volume, and scores on neuropsychological examinations such as NIH toolbox. There is a lot of evidence that correlations between hemodynamic measures and AD symptoms exist.\n",
              "Q. Where do the outcomes of prior research fall short? What need still exists that has not been satisfied by prior research?\n",
              "A. While strong correlations between hemodynamic measures and AD symptoms ahve been found, prior research has not successfully found a robust method for predicting AD development longitudinally, before clinical symptoms present. This is problematic because it means that we cannot detect AD early enough to prevent brain damage and cognitive decline.\n",
              "Q. Give a short summary of your proposed project. What approach will you use that has not been used before, and why will this approach enable you to satisfy the unmet need when prior research couldn&#x27;t?\n",
              "A. I will use convolutional neural networks to detect late-onset Alzheimer&#x27;s disease before cognitive symptoms become measureable. The input to the network will be cortical surface maps of cerebral blood flow and arterial transit time, calculated from arterial spin labeling MRI scans and FreeSurfer&#x27;s cortical surface reconstruction. This research is the first to use vertex-wise hemodynamic data directly as input to a CNN rather than using summary measures as inputs to a more traditional neural network structure. This may be more effective at early diagnosis than existing methods because vertex-wise data is incredibly high-dimensional and difficult for humans to interpret. However, this complexity may be exactly what is needed to predict symptomatic decline. \n",
              "Q. When you fill these holes in prior research, why will that be useful? How will it benefit the people suffering from the core issue?\n",
              "A. Earlier diagnosis means better treatment which means better patient outcomes. This will greatly reduce financial and emotional burden on both patients and caregivers everywhere, as well as save the U.S. healthcare system billions of dollars.\n",
              "Q. When you fill these holes in prior research, how will it move your field forward? How the concepts, methods, technologies, treatments, services, or preventative interventions that drive this field will be changed if the proposed aims are achieved?\n",
              "A. This will be groundbreaking work on a new research strategy of using hemodynamic cortical surface maps as direct inputs to CNNs for prediction of clinical variables. If achievable, this will not only focus the field on a promising new research avenue, but also provide a framework for using this new methodology to study other pathologies.\n",
              "Q. Why is NOW an opportune time for this research to be conducted? What new technological or conceptual advance has enabled this research such that it could not have been done in the past? Why is it pressing enough that it cannot wait until the future?\n",
              "A. Recent advances in the field of data science such as intuitive deep learning software packages, cloud computing services, and conceptual work on neural network structure has democratized what used to be considered advanced techniques. As recently as 10 years ago, very few labs would have had the compute power or computer science knowledge to conduct research with advanced CNN techniques. In addition, ASL MRI is a relatively new technique. multi-delay ASL allowing for the computation of ATT is even newer and still not widely available. There has never been a better tiem to perform this style of research.</span></div></div><div style='display: flex; border-bottom: 1px solid rgba(127, 127, 127, 0.2); align-items: center;'><div style='flex: 0 0 80px; opacity: 0.5;'>assistant</div><div style='flex-grow: 1; padding: 5px; padding-top: 10px; padding-bottom: 10px; margin-top: 0px; white-space: pre-wrap; margin-bottom: 0px;'><span style='background-color: rgba(0, 165, 0, 0.25); opacity: 1.0; display: inline;' title='{{gen &#x27;draft&#x27; max_tokens=1500}}'>Significance:\n",

              "Alzheimer&#x27;s Disease (AD) is a devastating neurodegenerative disorder that affects millions of individuals worldwide. The early detection of AD is crucial for effective intervention and prevention of brain damage and cognitive decline. However, current diagnostic methods are limited as they rely on the presence of measurable clinical symptoms, which often occur only after significant molecular pathology has already developed. This delay in detection hinders the ability to implement timely interventions and significantly impacts patient outcomes.\n",
              "\n",
              "The issue of early detection of AD is widespread, with more than 6 million Americans currently affected by the disease. The economic burden is also substantial, with AD projected to cost the US healthcare system $345 billion in 2023, and this cost is expected to exceed $1 trillion by 2050. Therefore, there is an urgent need to develop novel approaches that enable early detection of AD, leading to improved patient outcomes and reduced healthcare costs.\n",

              "To address this unmet need, our proposed project aims to utilize convolutional neural networks (CNNs) to detect late-onset AD before cognitive symptoms become measurable. This approach is novel as it directly incorporates vertex-wise hemodynamic data, derived from arterial spin labeling (ASL) MRI scans and FreeSurfer&#x27;s cortical surface reconstruction, as inputs to the CNN. By leveraging the high-dimensional nature of vertex-wise data, which is difficult for humans to interpret, we aim to capture subtle patterns and changes that may be indicative of early AD pathology.\n",

              "The outcomes of this research will have significant implications for both the field of AD research and the individuals affected by the disease. Early detection of AD will enable timely interventions, leading to better treatment outcomes and improved quality of life for patients. Additionally, the financial and emotional burden on patients and caregivers will be greatly reduced, and the healthcare system will save billions of dollars by avoiding the costs associated with advanced-stage AD care.\n",
              "\n",
              "Furthermore, this research will advance the field by introducing a new research strategy that utilizes hemodynamic cortical surface maps as direct inputs to CNNs for the prediction of clinical variables. This groundbreaking approach has the potential to revolutionize the field of AD research and provide a framework for studying other pathologies using similar methodologies. The advancements in data science, including deep learning software packages and cloud computing services, have made this research possible now, enabling a wider range of labs to conduct advanced CNN techniques.\n",
              "\n",
              "In conclusion, the proposed research addresses the critical need for early detection of AD, a disease that affects millions of individuals and imposes a significant economic burden. By utilizing novel approaches such as CNNs and vertex-wise hemodynamic data, we aim to fill the gaps in prior research and provide a more accurate and timely method for AD detection. The outcomes of this research will not only benefit patients and the healthcare system but also advance the field of AD research and pave the way for future investigations into other pathologies.
