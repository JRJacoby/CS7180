We will be the first to employ a neural network approach using cortical surface maps to directly detect AD. This novel methodology has the potential to outperform existing methods and provide more accurate and reliable early diagnosis of AD. By leveraging the power of CNNs, we can extract complex patterns and features from the cortical surface maps that may not be discernible to the human eye or traditional analysis methods. This has the potential to revolutionize the field of AD diagnosis and pave the way for more effective and personalized treatment strategies.\n",
              "\n",
              "The impact of our proposed project extends beyond the immediate benefits of early AD detection. By advancing our understanding of the relationship between CBF, ATT, and AD, we will contribute to the broader scientific knowledge in the field of neurodegenerative diseases. Our research has the potential to improve the technical capability of using neural networks for medical image analysis and diagnosis. Furthermore, the successful implementation of our methodology may inspire fellow researchers to explore the use of neural networks and multi-modal cortical surface data in other areas of medical research</span></div></div></pre></div>\n",
